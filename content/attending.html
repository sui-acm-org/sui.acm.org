	<h3>Additional Demo Reception and Banquet Tickets</h3>
	<p>If you would like to bring additional people (friends, colleagues, etc.) to the Demo Reception on Monday night (held at the hotel) or to the Conference Banquet (held at the <strong>TBA</strong>), you can purchase additional tickets during the registration process.  An additional ticket to the Demo Reception costs USD 50 and to the Conference Banquet USD 60.</p>
	-->

	<h3>Accessibility</h3>
	<p>SUI values the diversity of our community and aims to be an accessible
		and inclusive conference. If you have any questions or concerns about
		accessibility, please contact the conference accessibility chairs at
		<a href="local@sui.acm.org">local@sui.acm.org</a>, and they will work with you to address your concerns.
		Note that some requests may require advance notice, so please submit
		accessibility requests as far in advance of the conference date as
		possible in order to give us adequate time to prepare. The conference
		hotel offers the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Barrier-free access to all conference rooms</li>
		<li>Two parking spots reserved for disabled parking</li>
		<li>Two wheelchair-accessible rooms</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Children and Care Givers</h3>
	<p>We have options for child care. As this is very specific to the age of the child, the languages spoken and the need, please drop us an email to <a href="local@sui.acm.org">local@sui.acm.org</a> and we are happy to find a good solution. When you register yourself, you can also register children and/or a care giver (for yourself or for the child).</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Children</b> (10€) — registered children are welcome to attend any
			SUI event, including the Conference Banquet. No drink tickets will be
			included with child registration. You do not have to register your
			child, of course, but if you want to bring them to any of the events,
			they have to be formally registered so that they are covered by the ACM
			insurance.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p><b>Care Givers</b> (40€) — this registration category is for people
			providing care to the conference attendees with impairments or to the
			children of Conference Banquet. It grants the person access to
			all SUI events except the Conference Banquet. No drink tickets will be
			included with the care giver registration. If you would like your care
			giver to attend the Banquet, you will be able to purchase an additional
			Banquet ticket when you register your care giver.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Gary Marsden Student Development Fund</h3>
	<p>In recognition of Gary Marsden’s contributions and inspiration in HCI4D and support of HCI in the developing world, ACM SIGCHI established the Gary Marsden Student Development Fund in 2015. This fund is especially intended for sponsoring postgraduate students (Master or PhD degree) from and currently based in developing countries to attend SIGCHI (co)sponsored conferences as well as other HCI relevant conferences. In the last one year, 21 students were awarded by the fund. <a href="https://www.sigchi.org/conferences/funding/gary-marsden-student-development-fund">(More details)</a></p>
	<strong>Deadlines:</strong> 15th of February, May, August and November.

	<br>

	<h3>SIGCHI Student Travel Grant</h3>
	<p>The SIGCHI Student Travel Grant (SSTG) program is intended to enable students who lack other funding opportunities to attend SIGCHI-sponsored or co-sponsored conferences. This travel grant is intended to support students whose intention is to present at a SIGCHI-sponsored conference, not just attend. <a href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/student-travel-grants/student-travel-grant/">(More details)</a></p>
