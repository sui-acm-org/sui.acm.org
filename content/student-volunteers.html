	<p>To apply, fill out the application at the following <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/OGAOiW51jakQ0MBz2">Application Form</a>.</p>

	<h3>Benefits and Duties</h3>
	<p>If you are an ACM SUI Student Volunteer, you are committed to volunteer for approximately 10 hours during the conference. In return, you get <strong>free conference registration</strong> that gives you the chance to participate in a conference for innovations on spatial user interfaces and network with researchers in the field.</p>
	<p>Student volunteers are vital to the success of a conference. They allow conferences to run smoothly and provide attendees a friendly go-to person for assistance. They are also the heroes/heroines that help resolve any unexpected situations. Their specific duties include: bag stuffing, registration desk, AV assistance, poster and demo setup, badge checking, break monitoring, social media assistance and more. SVs usually get to attend most of the sessions, even when volunteering.</p>

	<h3>Arriving and Leaving</h3>
	<p>SVs need to be available to help throughout the conference. You will need to arrive on or before Friday afternoon (October 12) for the SV orientation and be available until the end of the conference on Sunday (October 14).</p>
