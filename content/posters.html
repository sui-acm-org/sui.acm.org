	<p>We invite you to participate in the <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2018/">ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI 2018)</a>, which will be co-located with the ACM Conference on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2018) in Berlin, Germany, by submitting a poster and a one-page extended abstract paper.
		Posters offer you the opportunity of engaging the audience of the Symposium at a personal level, elicit feedback on early stage work, and discuss potential collaborations in an informal manner. You will also be able to publicize your poster during the fast-forward session at the Symposium.
		We seek posters describing work in progress, novel ideas or systems, or late breaking results and application implementations from all areas of spatial user interaction. You can submit both a paper and a poster on the same topic, and some authors of otherwise rejected papers will be invited to present their work as a poster. Extra information such as videos may also be submitted. These will be taken into account during the review process and may be included in the final publication.</p>
