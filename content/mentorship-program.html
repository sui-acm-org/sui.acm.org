    <p>The mentorship program is intended primarily for authors from non-academia and undergraduate students.</p>
    <p>To help those with less experience in academic publication, ACM SUI 2018 offers assistance through two experienced Mentor Chairs. The mentors will provide guidance in composing your research paper, help frame your work in the context of other related work, and suggest improvements to the quality of your contribution. Although we cannot guarantee that your submission will be accepted by ACM SUI 2018, mentoring helps to turn your ideas into a research paper that could be accepted by a scientific event.</p>
    <p>If you wish to take advantage of this program, send an email to the Mentor Chairs at <a href="mailto:mentorship@sui.acm.org">mentorship@sui.acm.org</a> and include a 2-page document (please use the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">ACM Proceedings format</a>) describing your intended contribution. These two pages must include author names and affiliation (e.g., company name), and enough information for the chairs to understand your work, its contribution to the field, and how have you validated it (e.g., user evaluation, public demonstration). A brief video is strongly encouraged, but not required.</p>
    <p>Submissions are expected to address topics within the scope of SUI, i.e., one or more of the topics listed <a href="general-information#topics">here</a>. Unlisted but strongly related topics are also welcome.</p>
