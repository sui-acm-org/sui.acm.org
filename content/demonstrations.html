	<p>We invite you to showcase your demo at the ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI 2018), which will be co-located with the ACM Conference on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2018) in Berlin, Germany. Demos offer you the opportunity to engage the audience of the Symposium at a personal level, elicit feedback on your work, and discuss potential collaborations.</p>
	<p>We seek exciting research demonstrations, interactive experiences or commercial products from individuals, laboratories or research groups (academic, government, or industrial) from all areas of spatial user interaction. We are also open to artists who are focusing on the intersection between artistic expression and the technological mediums enabling spatial interaction.</p>
	<p>You can submit both a paper and a demo on the same topic, and some authors of otherwise rejected papers will be invited to present their work as a demo. Extra information such as videos may also be submitted. These will be taken into account during the review process and may be included in the final publication.</p>

	<p>This year, SUI will be co-located with the <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2018/">ACM Conference on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2018)</a> in Berlin, Germany. The authors of the best demos at SUI 2018 will be invited to present their demos at UIST 2018 as well.</p>

	<!-- instructions -->
	<h2 id="instructions">Submission Instructions</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Demo proposals should be prepared as a one-page manuscript. This description should include information about the overall architecture of the system, installation, exhibit or performance, interaction with the audience, foreseen benefits to audience members, as well as its relevance and impact on the SUI community, emphasizing on the novelty and rationale. In addition, a short paragraph with a description of the research lab or creators is strongly encouraged.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Please submit your extended abstract in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">Standard ACM Proceedings format</a>. For examples, please refer to sample-sigconf.pdf (Latex) and ACM_SigConf.pdf (Word) from the downloads on that page. Please use the camera-ready format. Note that demo submissions, unlike paper submissions, are not anonymous. Thus, be sure to include the names and affiliations of all authors. The extended abstracts of accepted demos will be included in the proceedings.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Supplementary materials should include a schematic of the layout (showing components such as projectors/cameras) of the demo and a picture showing the demo in action. Please include what equipment you will be bringing and other equipment/materials you are requesting, although we cannot guarantee any equipment will be provided, there may be a possibility depending on availability, need, travel, etc. Demos should be presentable in a conference setting.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>(Optional) A brief video of the demo in action. The video should demonstrate how users will interact with the demo as well as any other relevant information about the demo. This is optional, but the authors are strongly encouraged to prepare their videos in their submissions.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Submissions are expected to address topics within the scope of SUI, i.e., one or more of the topics listed <a href="general-information#topics">here</a>. Unlisted but strongly related topics are also welcome.</p>

	<h2 id="presenting">Presenting at the Symposium</h2>

	<p>SUI 2018 will provide basic infrastructure for the demos (space, a table, and power). Research demos will be expected to run during the dedicated demo session, lunch breaks and coffee breaks of the Symposium. In addition, authors of accepted demonstrations will have a time slot in the fast-forward session at the Symposium to publicize the demo.</p>

	<p>Please note that at least one author of each accepted demo will be required to register to present at the Symposium. The author is also required to be available during the demo viewing session.</p>
