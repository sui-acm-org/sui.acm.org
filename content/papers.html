	<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
	<p>As in previous years accepted papers will be presented in a single conference track, divided in thematically grouped sessions, with 3-4 papers in each session. Each session has an associated session chair, who will announce the presenter and the work and will moderate the Q&amp;A phase after each presentation. You can contact your session chair for particular questions concerning your presentation. Please come at least 15 minutes before your session begins to test your presentation.
	<br />
	The presentation time is 25+5 minutes for full papers and 17+3 minutes for short papers. Nevertheless, we recommend to keep your presentation a bit shorter and allow more time for Q&amp;A.</p>-->

	<h2 id="content">Submission Instructions</h2>
	<p>Full papers (normally 8 pages, maximum 10) must present original, highly innovative and forward-looking research or design work within the scope of spatial user interaction.<br />
	Short Papers (up to 4 pages) must also report novel research, but may include preliminary results or conceptual ideas. User interface evaluations are strongly encouraged for every publication in this venue.</p>
	<p>This year, selected papers will also be granted the opportunity to be <em>presented as poster</em> at <a href="https://uist.acm.org/uist2018/">ACM UIST 2018</a>, the co-located event taking place immediately after SUI.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Submissions must not be previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere and must not be under review by any other publication venue during SUI 2018&#8217;s reviewing period. Double submissions will be desk-rejected without review. In doubt, contact the program chairs or include properly anonymised version of the competitive manuscript as supplementary materials.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>All submissions should be prepared in the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html">ACM SIG Proceedings format</a>. For the Latex version, please use the <strong>sigconf</strong> template.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>SUI 2018 uses the new version of the <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/sui17a/">Precision Conference System</a>. Supplementary videos are strongly encouraged, but not required.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>Submitted papers should be <strong>anonymous</strong> for the double blind reviewing process. We strongly encourage you to <strong>not</strong> anonymize citations to your own works. These should not be omitted, but referenced in 3rd person. For example, you can write “In a study by Jones et al. [1]…” and reference your own paper, instead of “In my previous work [1]…”, with the reference listed as “[1] Blank for review.”</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>Highly relevant references to accepted, but still unavailable (i.e., “in press”) publications may be used, but should be included with author’s permission as supplementary materials.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>Submissions are expected to address topics within the scope of SUI, i.e., one or more of the topics listed <a href="general-information#topics">here</a>. Unlisted but strongly related topics are also welcome.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Submissions should be made through the <a href="http://new.precisionconference.com/sui18b/">online submission system</a>.</p>
		</li>

			<p>For further information and questions please <a href="mailto:program@sui.acm.com">contact the Program Chairs</a>.</p>

	<!-- Reviewing Process -->
	<hr class="major" />
	<h2>Reviewing Process</h2>
	<p>All papers will be reviewed by at least two external reviewers and two members of the <a href="organization#ipc">international program committee</a>. After the review cycle each submission will receive either an &#8220;Accept&#8220;, &#8220;Conditional Accept&#8221; or &#8220;Reject&#8221; decision. Some papers may be invited to be presented as a poster. Conditionally accepted papers should be revisited to address all changes requested by the primary reviewer, who will also shepherd the revision and assign the final decision for the paper (i.e., either &#8220;Accept&#8220; or &#8220;Reject&#8220;). Due to the tight conference schedule papers cannot be invited to do significant revisions. Thus, please submit your paper in the form you would like it to be published. Incomplete, off-topic, or otherwise non-competitive submissions will be desk-rejected without review.</p>
